# small-RNA-bioinformatics-code

This directory includes a few useful scripts I've used to analyze small RNA sequencing data.

nucleotide_density_plot.py graphs creates a single nucleotide histogram of sequencing reads at any locus, in any organism. Also, capable of normalizing data (RPM or internal normalization).
